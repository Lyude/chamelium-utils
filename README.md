# chamelium-utils

This is just a simple set of scripts I personally use for controlling the
Chamelium. Some of them are based off of scripts from the original chameleond
source code, the rest are just my own. Of course, you could just use the
`test_server` script chameleond provides, but I find having my own set of
command line utilities to be much easier for me to deal with.

## How to setup

Use the ./setup.py script for global installation, or just run the scripts as
is.
